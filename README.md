Spy Maze is a stealth theme arcade style game where the objective is to avoid enemies while traversing through a maze.

I created Spy Maze in highschool and it was the first game I ever created. I originally released it in November 2012.

Spy Maze can still be played for free on Google Play, the store listing can be found here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spymaze&hl=en
